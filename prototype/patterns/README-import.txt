How to import these JSONs as reusable blocks
-------------------------------------------

1) In WordPress admin, go to: Blocks > Manage Reusable blocks.
2) Click Import from JSON and upload any file from `prototype/patterns/`:
   - hero.json
   - features-3up.json
   - media-text.json
   - products-grid.json
   - posts-list.json
   - cta.json
3) In the editor, open the block inserter and switch to the Reusable tab.
4) Insert the desired reusable block into your page.
5) To convert to a normal block (detaching from reusable), select the inserted block and choose: Convert to regular blocks.

Notes for Snow Monkey
- After insertion, use Section blocks or Group block styles to match page spacing.
- Adjust colors to your theme palette if needed (Customizer > Colors).
- For News, the Query Loop shows your latest posts automatically.
